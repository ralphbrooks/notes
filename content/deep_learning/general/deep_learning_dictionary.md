**Catastrophic Forgetting** : A situation where the model forgets the task on which it was originally trained.
Discussed in [NAACL 2019 Transfer Learning Tutorial Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fIhGikFPnb7G5kr58OvYC3GN4io7MznnM0aAgadvJfc/edit#slide=id.g5a24b37ba6_3_865)


**Internal Covariate Shift** : This is the change in the distributions of internal nodes of a deep network. Discussed in 
[Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/batch-normalization-for-training-of-deep-neural-networks/).


**Sequential Adaptation** : Intermediate fine-tuning on related datasets and tasks.
