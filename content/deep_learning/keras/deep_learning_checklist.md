- Define the problem
- Identify a way to reliably measure success against a goal
- Prepare a validation process that you will use to evaluate models
- Vectorize the data
- Develop a model that beats a trivial common sense baseline
- Refine model architecture
- Get your model to overfit

After overfitting use the following to refine model architecture

- Add regularization (dropout) to the model
- Downsize the model to use lower capacity
