- [x] Define the problem
- [ ] Identify a way to reliably measure success against a goal
- [ ] Prepare a validation process that you will use to evaluate models
- [ ] Vectorize the data
- [ ] Develop a model that beats a trivial common sense baseline
- [ ] Refine model architecture
- [ ] Get your model to overfit
- [ ] After overfitting use the following to refine model architecture
a) Add regularization (dropout) to the model
b) Downsize the model to use lower capacity
