#### Current Projects

Currently, I am working on data science as well as building out the infrastructure needed to do distributed deep learning. Recently, I have been using TensorFlow in order to better understand emotion in language.
Specifically, I have been looking to see how deep learning can "filter out tweets that are not business critical". Work on this has involved everything from examining semi-supervised learning (Stanford's Snorkel research) to 
building an end to end pipeline to write out the results of different deep learning models into S3. This work has looked at bi-directional LSTMs as well as applications of BERT for transfer learning.
