# notes
Notes about machine learning, data science, NLP, and other interesting things. 

This is the push 5 with hugo.

Part of the setup involved:

~~git submodule add git://github.com/ralphbrooks/ralphbrooks.github.io.git docs~~
```bash
cd ~/Documents/python/github/notes
rm -rf docs
git submodule add -b master https://github.com/ralphbrooks/ralphbrooks.github.io.git docs
```

This whole thing has the goal of deploying to the github page.

This is now a clean pull in the mac.
